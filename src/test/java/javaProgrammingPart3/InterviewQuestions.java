    You are given an array of positive numbers from 1 to n,

    You have to find x. The input array is not sorted.

    I have an array of integers

    Given a dictionary of words and an input string,
    tell whether the input string can be completely segmented into dictionary words. Return a boolean.

    Write a function fib() that takes an integer n and returns the nth Fibonacci number.
    Note: The Fibonacci series is a numerical series where each item is the sum of the two previous items.
    It starts off like this: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21...

    Remove duplicate integers in an array
    e.g. [1,1,2,3,3,3,4,5] -> [1,2,3,4,5]

    Write a function that returns the longest sequence of consecutive zeroes in a binary string.
    e.g.
    Input  : arr[] = {1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1}
    Output : 4

    Sum of a 2D array

    /*
    Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
    Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
    Example :
    Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
    Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

    /*
    Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
    You can return the answer in any order.
    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
    Output: [0,1]
    Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

    /*
    Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k,
    and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.
    Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
    Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
